### Installing Dependencies

To get started execute the following commands:

<b>Step 1:</b> Install the dependencies with the following commands
```sh
brew update
brew install node
brew install mongoDB
```

<b>Step 2:</b> Navigate to your work directory<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Clone wanderlust repo and cd into it<br>
<b>Step 4:</b> Install npm and bower dependencies
```sh
npm install
bower install
```

<b>Step 5:</b> Run mongod in a new terminal window (see the Troubleshooting section below if you have encounter problems)
```sh
mongod
```

<b>Step 6:</b> Run grunt serve
```sh
grunt serve
```

<b>Step 7:</b> Start hacking!

### Troubleshooting

A frequently occurring error when running mongod was
```sh
ERROR: dbpath (/data/db) does not exist.
```

To fix this issue run the following command:
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
```
This should resolve the issue and allow you to run mongod in the command line.
